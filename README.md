## **About Me**
I like working on **low-level programming, graphics programming, systems engineering and performance optimization**. I primarily work with **C/C++ and ASM (web and x86)** along  with **Rust, Bash, Zig** (and the occasional **Python and Dart**). My interests include **Operating systems, Compiler Design, Graphics, Multimedia, Computer Networking, and UI/UX for CLI/TUI apps**. I actively experiment with **FFmpeg, LLVM, Wayland, OpenGL, Linux** and anything I like really. 

Mostly wasting my time trying to make tools/utilities that I would love to have. Also trying to find myself under the walls of sound.
